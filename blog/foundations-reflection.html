        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        I've become more aware of myself, which helps me understand my thoughts
        and emotions and how they affect what I do. I've also realized that my
        ego can sometimes get in the way, but now I’m more careful to manage it,
        especially when I interact with others or make decisions. I’ve also
        found that I’m more open to learning and growing, which makes me excited
        and motivates me to keep improving.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques-values">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        Values, empathy, and self-awareness are important in both learning and
        programming. Values guide me how to learn and code, helping me stay
        focused on what matters, like being ethical and responsible. Empathy
        allows us to understand others’ perspectives, which improves teamwork
        and helps to grow as a team. And Self-awareness is crucial because it
        allows me to recognize my strengths and limitations, driving personal
        improvement that positively impacts my coding journey.

        What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        When I first started focusing on human skills, I didn’t think they would
        make much of a difference. However, after Sprint 2, I began to realize
        how they have transformed the way I approach coding and learning.
        Concepts like neuroplasticity and mindset growth have especially changed
        my perspective, helping me understand how adaptable my brain is and how
        this flexibility improves both my learning process and coding skills.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques-values">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        Rewiring old habits through the concept of neuroplasticity can be
        challenging because it involves changing the brain’s established
        pathways.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques-values">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        Because technical skills alone aren't enough for success. Human skills
        like communication, teamwork, and self-awareness are crucial for working
        well with others, solving problems creatively, and adapting to new
        challenges. These skills help developers collaborate effectively, handle
        client interactions, and keep learning as the tech world evolves. By
        building both technical and human skills, the Bootcamp prepares students
        to be well-rounded and successful in their careers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques-values">
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        As I mentioned earlier, after Sprint 2, my perspective changed. I
        realized that Human Skills are essential for growth in both personal and
        professional life. They help me not only become a better programmer but
        also improve how I communicate, collaborate, and adapt in different
        situations.
