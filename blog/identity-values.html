        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

        One of my long-term employees, who had been with the company for over
        three years and had earned my trust, was unfortunately caught engaging
        in misconduct on site. This was unexpected, as she had always
        demonstrated reliability and professionalism. I faced a difficult
        decision, as I valued her contributions and had a good working
        relationship with her. I immediately disclosed the situation to my
        superior to ensure transparency. After careful consideration, I decided
        to handle the matter internally without involving law enforcement. I
        believed that addressing the situation in a way that allowed her to exit
        the company respectfully, while maintaining her dignity, was a balanced
        approach. My goal was to resolve the issue without unnecessarily
        damaging her future career prospects, while also upholding company
        standards and integrity. Ultimately, I held a private meeting with her,
        explained the gravity of the situation, and we mutually agreed on her
        departure from the company. This allowed us to handle the situation
        professionally and respectfully, ensuring a smooth resolution without
        escalating tensions or creating a negative atmosphere. This version
        frames the situation professionally and emphasizes the balance between
        maintaining integrity and handling the matter with compassion.

        As a Sikh, my values and identity are shaped by core principles such as
        Seva (selfless service), equality, and honesty. The teachings of
        Sikhism, like the emphasis on hard work and standing up for justice,
        guide my personal and professional life. My strong family ties and
        involvement in the Sikh community reinforce values like humility,
        compassion, and service.

        My strengths will greatly benefit my studies as a software developer. My
        problem-solving skills will help me effectively address coding
        challenges and understand complex programming concepts by breaking them
        into smaller, manageable tasks. A strong work ethic will keep me
        disciplined and focused, ensuring I thoroughly grasp each topic before
        progressing. My quick learning ability allows me to swiftly adapt to new
        programming languages and technologies, keeping pace with the
        ever-evolving tech field.

        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        n evaluating my limitations in terms of learning and career development,
        I recognize a few potential challenges. My tendency to go down rabbit
        holes, exploring topics in depth that I find particularly interesting,
        can sometimes lead to spending excessive time on less critical areas,
        which might slow overall progress. Additionally, my perfectionism can
        cause delays as I might focus too much on refining details rather than
        advancing with my learning objectives. I also tend to become frustrated
        with slow progress, which can affect my motivation and persistence
        during more challenging phases of my journey. Moreover, balancing
        multiple learning goals or projects simultaneously can be difficult,
        potentially impacting my focus and efficiency. To address these issues,
        I plan to set clear goals, manage my time effectively, and seek regular
        feedback to ensure I stay on track and maintain a balanced approach to
        my learning and career development.

        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.

      <p class="ans-values">
        As a store manager, I noticed that some team members weren’t working as
        hard as others. To fix this, I planned ahead and divided the tasks more
        fairly so everyone could contribute equally. This approach led to better
        results. Looking back, I see how important planning is. In the future,
        I’ll start each week by reviewing and scheduling tasks with proper time
        for each, to get better outcomes.
