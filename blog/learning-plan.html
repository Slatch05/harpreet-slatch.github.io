      <p class="ques">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
      <p class="ans">
        Long-Term Goal: My long-term goal is to become a software engineer, with
        a particular focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.
        <br />
        <br />

        Skills Application: I plan to continue learning even after completing
        Dev Academy, ensuring I stay updated with the latest technologies and
        methodologies in the field. I aim to apply the skills I gain during this
        course to secure a position in software development that allows me to
        work on innovative projects.
        <br />
        <br />

        Impact: I aspire to contribute to advancements in machine learning and
        artificial intelligence, creating solutions that can positively impact
        various industries and improve people's lives.

        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        One of my key strengths is my belief in the power of teamwork and
        collaborative growth. As a people person, I find it easy to connect with
        others and foster a supportive environment where we can all thrive
        together. On the other hand, a limitation I face is that I sometimes
        take a bit longer to grasp new concepts. However, I am confident in my
        ability to eventually understand the material and catch up, ensuring
        that I meet my goals in the learning process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        One of the biggest non-technical challenges I will anticipate during
        Bootcamp is maintaining self-care while managing a demanding study
        schedule of around 70 hours a week. The intensity of the program can
        make it easy to prioritize coursework over my well-being. To address
        this, I plan to incorporate regular breaks, physical activity, and
        mindfulness practices into my routine. By setting aside dedicated time
        for self-care, I can ensure that I remain focused and energized,
        allowing me to perform at my best throughout the Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        At Dev Academy, I want to improve my communication, teamwork, and
        feedback skills. I also aim to enhance my self-awareness to better
        understand my strengths and weaknesses. These skills will help me
        succeed in my future career.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>
      <p class="ans">
        I expect the Bootcamp team to offer strong guidance and support
        throughout the program. I also hope to receive constructive feedback
        that will help me grow both technically and personally, as well as
        assistance in securing a job after completing the Bootcamp.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
      <p class="ans">
        I am committed to giving my best effort during Bootcamp and will focus
        on thoroughly understanding concepts without rushing through them. I
        recognize that this experience will be more intense and demanding
        compared to the foundation course, requiring a minimum of 70-80 hours of
        work each week. I’m ready to embrace this challenge and push myself to
        grow both personally and professionally.

      <p class="ques">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        Strengths: I am a quick learner, especially when I’m motivated, and I
        can efficiently grasp new concepts. I’m goal-oriented and able to
        achieve targets within the given timeframe, ensuring that I meet
        deadlines without sacrificing quality.
        <br /><br />
        Limitations: When I’m deeply interested in a topic, I tend to get
        absorbed and go down rabbit holes, exploring things in great detail.
        While this helps in gaining deeper insights, it can cause me to lose
        track of time, which sometimes impacts my overall time management.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I’d like to develop strong communication and problem-solving skills, as
        well as persistence in learning. I want to ensure that if I don’t fully
        understand a topic, I don’t skip it but instead work through it until I
        have a solid grasp. Developing resilience and adaptability would also be
        important for my growth at Dev Academy.

        How you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
        learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I will fully participate in all activities, arrive on time, and treat
        everyone with respect. I’ll ask for help when necessary and offer
        support to others.
      </p>

      <p class="ques">
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I will take a step back to evaluate the situation, prioritize tasks,
        break down issues, create a plan, and address them one by one.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I’m committed to first attempting to solve problems on my own. If
        needed, I’ll turn to reliable online resources like Stack Overflow and
        other technical forums. If I’m still stuck, I’ll reach out to
        facilitators or collaborate with fellow learners for guidance. This
        approach ensures I seek help in a timely and effective way while
        promoting self-reliance and teamwork.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p class="ques">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I expect the facilitation team to be there for support when I’m stuck
        and need help. They won’t be my first stop, as I prefer to try solving
        things on my own first, but I’ll reach out when I need guidance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I don’t have many commitments, but I will still be working on weekends
        to cover my expenses, as I’m not receiving any study allowances. I’ll
        plan my schedule accordingly to ensure I stay on track with my studies.
