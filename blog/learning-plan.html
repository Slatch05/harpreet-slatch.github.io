      <p class="ques">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
      <p class="ans">
        My long-term goal is to build a career as a software developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        Strengths: I am a quick learner, especially when I’m motivated, and I
        can efficiently grasp new concepts. I’m goal-oriented and able to
        achieve targets within the given timeframe, ensuring that I meet
        deadlines without sacrificing quality.
        <br /><br />
        Limitations: When I’m deeply interested in a topic, I tend to get
        absorbed and go down rabbit holes, exploring things in great detail.
        While this helps in gaining deeper insights, it can cause me to lose
        track of time, which sometimes impacts my overall time management.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I’d like to develop strong communication and problem-solving skills, as
        well as persistence in learning. I want to ensure that if I don’t fully
        understand a topic, I don’t skip it but instead work through it until I
        have a solid grasp. Developing resilience and adaptability would also be
        important for my growth at Dev Academy.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        How you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
        learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I will fully participate in all activities, arrive on time, and treat
        everyone with respect. I’ll ask for help when necessary and offer
        support to others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I will take a step back to evaluate the situation, prioritize tasks,
        break down issues, create a plan, and address them one by one.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I’m committed to first attempting to solve problems on my own. If
        needed, I’ll turn to reliable online resources like Stack Overflow and
        other technical forums. If I’m still stuck, I’ll reach out to
        facilitators or collaborate with fellow learners for guidance. This
        approach ensures I seek help in a timely and effective way while
        promoting self-reliance and teamwork.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p class="ques">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I expect the facilitation team to be there for support when I’m stuck
        and need help. They won’t be my first stop, as I prefer to try solving
        things on my own first, but I’ll reach out when I need guidance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </p>
      <p class="ans">
        I don’t have many commitments, but I will still be working on weekends
        to cover my expenses, as I’m not receiving any study allowances. I’ll
        plan my schedule accordingly to ensure I stay on track with my studies.
