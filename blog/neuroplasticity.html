      <p class="ques-values">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        A Growth Mindset is the belief that intelligence and abilities can be
        developed through effort, learning and determination. Opposite to growth
        mindset its fixed mindset where people are their abilities as a static.
      </p>

      <p class="ques-values">
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you. Change for you.
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        A surprising realization is how much a Growth Mindset can reshape
        everyday life. I found that simply viewing challenges as chances to
        learn, rather than as threats, makes a big difference in how we approach
        and overcome obstacles. It shifts the focus from fear of failure to
        growth and improvement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="ques-values">
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey.
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        Never quit what you started and keep learning. Sometimes it will take
        time but if you stay persistent and focused and keep grow it will
        eventually see progress.

      <p class="ans-values">
        With this I will approach difficult tasks as an opportunities to learn,
        not as obstacle. Instead of aiming perfection I will focus on progress
        and the area where I can improve.
