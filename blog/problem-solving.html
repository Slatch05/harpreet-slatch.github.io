      <p class="ans-values">
        I encountered an issue with spacing in my code, which had me stuck for
        over 30 minutes before I finally reached out for help on Discord. I
        applied various problem-solving techniques, including step-by-step
        debugging, researching online, and breaking the code down into smaller
        sections. Ultimately, the issue was something very very simple. To
        better understand what was happening, I used console.log("Hello World")
        to check the flow of the program. This experience taught me that even
        the smallest details, like spacing, can prevent code from functioning
        properly.

      <p class="ques-values">Elegantly solved a problem.</p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        I found the JS-Olympics challenges to be easier compared to others,
        particularly the task of removing odd numbers. While it wasn’t a
        difficult problem, I was able to solve it in the simplest, most
        efficient, and effective way I could think of. The approach I used made
        me feel accomplished because it not only worked well but also adhered to
        best practices. I focused on writing code that was clean and concise,
        using the least amount of time and resources while maintaining both
        clarity and functionality. One of the key factors I considered was
        readability—anyone looking at the code should be able to understand it
        easily without additional explanation. By ensuring that the solution was
        both elegant and straightforward, I was able to achieve a balance
        between performance and simplicity. Solving the problem this way gave me
        a sense of satisfaction, knowing that I didn’t overcomplicate it and
        that my solution was as effective as possible.

        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        <strong style="font-weight: 500">Pseudocode :</strong> It helps me to
        break down the problem and makes me focus on on the solution structure.
        Save alot of time. <br />
        <strong style="font-weight: 500">Rubber Ducky Method :</strong> When I
        read a question or problem, I explain it to myself. This helps me
        understand it better. Talking to myself about what I'm learning makes
        things clearer. It helps me see what I know and what I don't know. This
        trick works well for many subjects. It makes hard ideas easier to get.
        <br />
        <strong style="font-weight: 500">Reading error messages :</strong> I am
        not that confident reading all the error yet. But, it definitely helps
        to solve the problem/error faster. <br />
        <strong style="font-weight: 500">Console.logging :</strong> Very
        confident with this method. It's my go-to tool, allowing me to track the
        flow to data and identify issues. <br />
        <strong style="font-weight: 500">Googling :</strong> I feel very
        confident with searching in Google specially: stockflow, W3school amd
        MDM web docs as i use this when i need them. <br />
        <strong style="font-weight: 500"
          >Asking peers and coaches for help :</strong
        >
        While I am comfortable reaching out to peers and coaches. I usually try
        to solve problem on my own. However, when I see no light, I don't
        hesitate to ask them. Specially, coaches can offer valuble perspectives
        and insightful guidance. <br />
        <strong style="font-weight: 500"
          >Improving your process with reflection :</strong
        >
        After finishing a task, I usually take time to think about what worked,
        what didn’t, and how I can do better next time. I feel that reflection
        helps alot.
      </p>

      <p class="ques-values">
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </p>
      <p class="ans-values">
        I usually ask questions when I get stuck, but this time I hesitated
        because of the timing. I assumed my peers and coaches might be asleep,
        so I didn’t reach out for help right away. Instead, I spent more time
        working through the problem on my own and eventually solved it. And for
        next time I would try to reaching out sonner as it save alot of time
        which could be used for another thing.
